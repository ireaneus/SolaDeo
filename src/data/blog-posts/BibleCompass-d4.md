## Day 4 for the SD Crew – The Cross in the Clearing

### Scene 10 – The Clearing with the Cross

![Kneeling before the Cross](/SolaDeo/images/Gemini_CrossKneel.webp)

The next morning, the Crew set out once again along the narrow trail. The woods grew darker and closer until, at last, the trees opened into a quiet clearing. At the center stood a tall, weathered wooden cross. The air was hushed and still, as if even the forest knew this was a holy place.

Samuel stopped, his lantern glowing faintly in the dim light. *“Papa… is this what I think it is?”*

Papa nodded. *“Yes. The cross is the heart of our journey. It reminds us of what Jesus did for us. Long ago, when Moses stood before the burning bush, God told him to take off his sandals because he was standing on holy ground. This place is holy too.”*

Slowly, the children slipped off their shoes and socks. The cool grass pressed between their toes, fresh and soft. Charlie laughed as the blades tickled his feet, running in circles as he chased a butterfly.  

Abi stood quietly, her heart pounding as she remembered Britt’s words from the porch the night before. *“So this is real… He really loved me enough to die for me,”* she thought.

### Scene 11 – Burden Lifted

Papa unrolled the map and read aloud:

> *“He Himself brought our sins in His body up on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live for righteousness; by His wounds you were healed.”* — 1 Peter 2:24 (NASB 2020)

He looked at the Crew. “In *Pilgrim’s Progress*, Christian carried a heavy burden on his back until he came to the cross. Only here did the burden roll away. The cross reminds us that Jesus carried our burden of sin, and He sets us free.”

Michael’s eyes grew steady. *“That means we don’t have to carry our guilt anymore.”*

*“Exactly,”* Papa said. *“The Bible also says, ‘He canceled the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us … having nailed it to the cross.’*” — **Colossians 2:14 (NASB 2020)**

Abi whispered, *“So He took all of mine too?”*

Grammy knelt beside her and signed gently, *“Yes, Abi. All of yours. That’s how much He loves you.”*

Then Papa handed each one a small piece of paper and a pencil. *“I want you to write down something you need Jesus to forgive, or a burden you’ve been carrying. It can be a word, a thought, or even just a picture.”*

The clearing was quiet as they wrote. Grammy helped Reagan and Charlie with theirs, guiding their little hands. One by one, they walked to the cross. A hammer and nails lay at its base. Each child lifted their paper and, with steady hands, nailed it to the wood. The sharp tap of the hammer echoed in the stillness.  

When Abi pressed her note to the cross, her hands trembled. As the nail sank into the wood, tears filled her eyes — not of fear, but of hope. For the first time, she felt her burden was no longer hers to carry.

Papa’s voice was gentle as he looked around at the Crew. *“Now when you look at the cross, remember: your burdens are gone, and His love is forever. Jesus carried it all, so you don’t have to.”*

Grammy’s eyes shone as she began to sing softly, her hands moving in gentle signs so Abi could follow every word:

*“Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good,*  
*For His mercy is everlasting.”* — **Psalm 136:1 (NASB 2020)**

The children’s voices joined hers one by one, the words rising into the quiet clearing. Abi sang haltingly at first, then with growing strength, her hands shaping the signs as Grammy guided her. The song lingered in the air, a chorus of love and gratitude, before fading back into the stillness of the woods.

### Scene 12 – The Next Step

Then Papa pointed to the path that wound upward beyond the clearing. It looked steep, with brambles clutching at the edges.

*“This is the way forward,”* Papa said. *“It won’t always be easy. But remember—Jesus carried the heaviest burden for us. Because of the cross, we can trust Him with every step ahead.”*

The Crew tightened their grips on their lanterns and on each other’s hands. With one last look at the cross, they stepped forward into the thickening woods, their hearts lighter than before.

## SD Crew and Family Prayer time

*“Lord Jesus, thank You for carrying my burden on the cross. Thank You that by Your wounds I am healed, and my sins are forgiven. Help me to live each day remembering Your love and trusting You with the path ahead.”*

## The SD Crew Thought for the day

At the cross, Jesus carried our burden and set us free—because His love is stronger than our sin.
