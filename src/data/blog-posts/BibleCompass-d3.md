## Day 3 for the SD Crew – God’s Love for Abi

### Scene 7 – Back at the Farmhouse

The sun was dipping low when the Crew returned to the farmhouse for supper. Grammy had spread bread, cheese, and jars of jam across the table. Papa was outside feeding the animals, while the younger kids played in the yard, laughter echoing in the fading light.

Abi stood quietly on the porch steps, a flower twirling between her fingers. Britt standing nearby, signing gently in ASL so Abi could follow every word.

Abi asked, “Why does Papa keep reading bible verses to us? I don’t always understand them.”

Britt smiled. “That’s because every verse is part of a love story—God’s story. And it’s written for you.”

Abi signed back. "You mean the Bible was written for me?" Britt's eyes met with Abi's as she signed, "Yes, the whole Bible is for you."

### Scene 8 – The Gospel Explained

Britt leaned closer, her hands steady as she signed:  
“God made us to know Him, to walk with Him, and to live as His children. The Bible says, *‘See how great a love the Father has given us, that we would be called children of God; and in fact we are.’*” — 1 John 3:1 (NASB 2020)

Abi’s eyes softened. “We are God’s children?”

Britt nodded with a smile. “Yes. He loves us so much that He came close to us. The Bible says, *‘By this the love of God was revealed in us, that God has sent His only Son into the world so that we may live through Him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.’*” — 1 John 4:9–10 (NASB 2020)

Abi’s eyes grew wide. “So God sent Jesus because He loved us?”

Britt nodded again. “Exactly. The Bible also says, *‘But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.’*” — Romans 5:8 (NASB 2020)

She signed carefully so Abi could catch every word:  
*“For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”* — Romans 6:23 (NASB 2020)

Then Britt leaned closer, her expression warm. “**Jesus gave His life because He loves you.** When He rose again, it proved that His love is stronger than death. And if you believe this is true—that Jesus died for you and rose again—all you need to do is respond to Him. The Bible says, *‘That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.’*” — Romans 10:9–10 (NASB 2020)

Britt continued, signing slowly and tenderly:  
“Jesus died to pay the penalty for our sins—all the ways we disobey God. But when He rose from the dead, it showed that the Father accepted His sacrifice and opened the way for us to be forgiven. Abi, if you believe this—that Jesus, God’s Son, died for your sins and is alive with the Father—and you want to make Him Lord of your life, we can pray to Him right now.”

Abi traced her finger along the porch rail, her voice barely a whisper as she signed back, “I never knew His love was for me too.”

### Scene 9 – Flowers in Her Lap

Just then, Reagan bounded up, arms full of blossoms. She placed them into Abi’s hands. “Here—these are too pretty to keep to myself.”

Abi smiled faintly, tucking the flowers into her lap. For the first time, she felt the truth settling deep into her heart: God loved her, and He wanted her to belong to Him.  

Papa’s voice carried from the yard. “Children, come in! It’s time for our evening prayer.”

As they stood, Britt signed one last promise: *“If you ever want to talk more, I’ll walk with you. That’s what family is for.”*

Abi nodded slowly, holding the flowers tight. The love of God was no longer just something she’d heard—it was something she was beginning to believe.

## SD Crew and Family Prayer time

“Father, thank You for loving me before I ever loved You. Thank You for sending Jesus to show Your love by dying for me and rising again. I confess Jesus as Lord, and I believe in my heart that You raised Him from the dead. Help me live in Your love every day.”

## The SD Crew Thought for the day

God’s story is a love story: He created us, He loves us, He sent Jesus for us—and we can respond by believing and belonging to Him.
