## SD Crew Memory Verse

> “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.”

## Day 1 for the SD Crew - The search for hidden treasure

### Scene 1 - the Farmhouse

The smell of fresh biscuits filled the kitchen. Grammy hummed as she packed sandwiches, apples, and a bottle of water into a canvas picnic bag. The table was set with mugs of hot cocoa.

Samuel, Michael, Reagan, and little Charlie were finishing breakfast when Papa Dave stepped inside with a twinkle in his eye and a rolled-up leather map tied with twine.

“Today,” Papa began, “we begin a journey to find hidden treasure. But you can only reach it by following clues from God’s Word.”

Grammy placed the picnic bag down. “Before you go,” she said softly, “let’s pray.”

They all joined hands around the table.

“Lord,” Grammy prayed, “thank You for this day and for our family. Light our path with Your Word. Keep us safe, help us hear Your voice, and draw us closer to You and each other. Amen.”

### Scene 2 – The Forest Lanterns

The cool hush of the forest wrapped around them as they left the farmhouse behind. Dew clung to the grass and leaves, sparkling in the thin beams of early sunlight that slipped through the canopy overhead. Birds stirred in the branches, their songs weaving through the stillness like a gentle prelude.

Papa led the way along the narrow trail, the rolled-up leather map tucked under his arm. When they reached a small clearing, he stopped and turned to face the children.

From a canvas satchel, he drew out four small brass lanterns, each with a glass pane that caught the morning light. He handed one to each of the older kids.

*“These,”* Papa said with a twinkle in his eye, *“will light your way, but only when you find the next clue.”*

Samuel stepped forward, carefully unrolling the map. His eyes scanned the parchment until he found the first words written in Papa’s careful handwriting:

> “Your word is a lamp to my feet And a light to my path.” — Psalm 119:105 (NASB 2020)

The moment Samuel read the verse aloud, each lantern flickered to life, filling the clearing with a warm golden glow. The children gasped, exchanging delighted glances.

Papa smiled. *“It’s God’s Word that shows us where to walk, even when the path is dark. Remember what Jesus said —”*  
He paused, quoting softly,

> “I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.” — John 8:12 (NASB 2020)

The glow from the lanterns seemed to grow warmer at His words, casting long beams that reached into the trees ahead. Abi held hers up and whispered, “It’s like the light wants us to follow.”

Papa nodded. *“Exactly. Let’s go see where God’s Word leads us next.”*

With lanterns held high, they stepped forward into the cool green shade, their lights dancing ahead like little promises.

### Scene 3 - The Wide and Narrow Paths

They walked until the trail split in two. One path, wide and smooth, sloped gently downhill toward a sunlit meadow where the grass swayed in the breeze. The other was a narrow, uneven track that disappeared into the dense woods, its way twisted with roots and shadowed by towering trees.

Samuel pointed to the wide path. *“That one’s easier!”* he said, already imagining the soft grass under his feet.

Michael shook his head and tapped the map. *“But the map says the right path isn’t always easy.”*

Papa unrolled the next clue and read aloud, his voice steady:

> “Enter through the narrow gate… For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life.” — Matthew 7:13–14 (NASB 2020)

![Papa Narrow path](/SolaDeo/images/Papa-narrow-path.webp)

The group grew quiet. A breeze stirred the leaves above. Reagan leaned down to Charlie’s level, squeezing his small hand. *“I think we should go the narrow way,”* she whispered, smiling gently.

They turned toward the shadowed path, the lanterns in their hands glowing a little brighter, as if approving their choice. The air grew cooler, the forest thicker. The muffled sounds of birds gave way to the distant roar of rushing water, unseen but close.

Papa read the day’s final verse:

> “The unfolding of Your words gives light; It gives understanding to the simple.” — Psalm 119:130 (NASB 2020)  

The path curved sharply into deep shadow. Golden lantern light danced against the dark trees. Papa grinned, tucking the scroll into his coat.  

*“Tomorrow,” he said, “we’ll see what’s around that bend.”*

## The SD Crew Thought for the day

God’s Word is like a compass and a lantern—it always points to the right path.
